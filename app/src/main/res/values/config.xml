    Android App Bundles split up the app into several APKs.
    We always back up all the available split APKs
    and do a compatibility check when re-installing them.
    If a backed up split is not compatible, the re-install will fail
    and the user will be given the opportunity to install the app manually before data restore.
    Unknown splits are treated as compatible as we haven't yet seen a case
    where this would cause a problem such as an app crashing when starting it after re-install.
    However, if you prefer to be on the safe side, you can set this to true,
    to only install unknown splits if they come from the same device.
